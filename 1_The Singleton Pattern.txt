	The Hibernate comes in many collections, but we’ll briefly cover the nine individual items that are mentioned in the Topic Collections and Resources guide. They are: the Singleton Pattern, the Proxy Pattern, the Factory Pattern, HQL, Many to Many, examples and diagrams, declarations and descriptions, Many to One and One to Many relationships and Bi-directional one to many relationships.

	The Singleton Pattern pulls from the Abstract Factory, Builder and Prototype patterns only in implementation. In this way, the abstract factory pattern “provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.”
