#The Factory Method Pattern#

• Defining a "virtual" constructor

Factory Method is to creating objects as Template Method is to implementing an algorithm. A superclass specifies all standard
and generic behavior (using pure virtual "placeholders" for creation steps), and then delegates the creation details to
subclasses that are supplied by the client.

Factory Method makes a design more customizable and only a little more complicated. Other design patterns require new classes,
whereas Factory Method only requires a new operation.

People often use Factory Method as the standard way to create objects; but it isn't necessary if: the class that's instantiated
never changes, or instantiation takes place in an operation that subclasses can easily override (such as an initialization
operation).

Factory Method is similar to Abstract Factory but without the emphasis on families.

Factory Methods are routinely specified by an architectural framework, and then implemented by the user of the framework.

• Abstract Factory classes are often implemented with Factory Methods, but they can be implemented using Prototype
• Factory Methods are usually called within Template Methods
• Prototype doesn't require subclassing, but it does require an Initialize operation. Factory Method requires subclassing, but
doesn't require Initialize
